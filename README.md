# Find the TV Show / Movie v1.0

Description

From the App you can search for a movie or TV show and you can see the image of the Movies / TV Shows, the title, the description, the ratings, the genres and the languages that is available.

Details

The app built with JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 library.

In HTML file, I have the search bar and the button where the user can type the movie / TV show title or a word that of the movie / TV show. 
In JavaScript, when the user clicks the Search button the input of the user stored in a value which is passed to the url of the API.
I call the API whith Axios and I created a function which loops the results of the requested data, creates col-4 divs and cards from Bootstrap 5 library.
